# CSE134B HW2 — Portfolio (Starter)

This starter site includes semantic HTML pages required for HW2 and placeholder assets so you can deploy quickly.

## Files included
- index.html
- projects.html
- experiments.html
- about.html
- contact.html
- sample-replication.html
- /projects/project-1.html, project-2.html, project-3.html
- /assets/styles.css
- /assets/resume.pdf (placeholder)
- /assets/images/*.jpg (placeholder images)

## Notes
- Keep global CSS minimal to comply with assignment rules.
- The experiments page demonstrates required tags; MathML is included for extra credit.
- Deploy to Netlify from this repo root (index.html should be at root).

Replace placeholder content and images with your real content before submission.
